This is a music recommender application built with Next.js as part of my thesis project
The app uses Spotify Web API data to access users' listening history. The app provides song suggestions based on listening history.
A valid Spotify account is required in order to use the application.

A recommender algoritm is built for the application in order to suggest songs. The algoritm calculates similarities of tracks using Euclidean distance.
Actual algoritm code can be found under `src/lib/functions`.

## How to use

The app is running at https://music-recommender-app.vercel.app/.
If you want to try out the music-recommender-app, please send me your email that is used in your Spotify Account.
This is required for now, otherwise the app won't let you authorize.
