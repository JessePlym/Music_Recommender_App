# üéµ Music Recommender Application

This is a music recommendation web application as part of my thesis project. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that uses [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to provide personalized song suggestions based on your listening history and preferences. Authentication is handled using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), with Spotify as the provider. A recommender algoritm is built for the application in order to suggest songs. The algoritm calculates similarities of tracks using Euclidean distance.
Actual algoritm code can be found under `src/lib/functions`.

## üöÄ Features

- **Spotify Authentication**: Secure login using your Spotify account with NextAuth.
